# Tesla clone website

A clone of the official Tesla website, made in React using Styled Components for organised and clean styling. Styled Components are a fantastic way to keep styling within components and using variables through props on the styled component. The React application uses a local JSON file and a little bit of Redux to mimic a larger (headless) CMS-based application.
